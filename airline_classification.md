Our data covers "reporting airlines" which are airlines that are mandated to report their statistics to the Department of Transportation.
An airline becomes a reporting airline if their revenue is at least a certain % of US domestic passenger revenue. This threshold has changed over time (https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/bts3817#:~:text=Beginning%20in%202018%2C%20airlines%20with,effect%20from%201987%20through%202017.)
As a result, not every airline is present in every month/year. For instance, Spirit (NK) was not a reporting airline in January 2010.
As we comb through the data, we might run into more airlines than in the following list, at which point we should enlarge the list. 

HS = Hub and Spoke  
PTP = Point to Point  
B = Budget  
L = Legacy  
H = Hybrid  
R = Regional  
* = present in Nov 2025
