# spring-2026-airline-reliability

The goal of this project is to train a model that would allow the user to input details about a potential flight (pre-existing or not) and return the odds that their flight is delayed and by how much. We then conduct a multivariate analysis of which factors affect reliability and timeliness in air travel in the US as measured through airline delays and cancelations.

There are a wide variety of factors to consider, such as the carrier strategy (hub and spoke model vs point to point), legacy vs budget airlines, origin and destination airports, cause of delay, etc. We would like to investigate how to these affect the on-time arrival and cancelation rates of the airlines and how do the different airlines fare when controlling for some of these factors.

Do different carriers strategies affect reliability given localized vs widespread weather events?
Certain airports/city markets are notoriously congested. When controlling for this does the disparities between different airlines vanish?
Do regional airlines fare better than national ones? Does this change when controlling for the number of weather-related disruptions in different regions?
Does any of this changes when considering pre- vs post- covid data? Do certain airline groups transition better than others?
